Abstract
======
We introduce Ouroboros, a new Key Exchange protocol based
on coding theory. The protocol gathers the best properties of the recent
MDPC-McEliece and HQC protocols for the Hamming metric: simplicity of
decoding and security reduction, based on a double cyclic structure. This
yields a simple, secure and efficient approach for key exchange. We obtain
the same type of parameters (and almost the same simple decoding) as for
MDPC-McEliece, but with a security reduction to decoding random quasi-
cyclic codes in the Random Oracle Model.
