Abstract
======
In 2012, Lyubashevsky introduced a new framework for building
lattice-based signature schemes without resorting to any trapdoor (such as
GPV [6] or NTRU [7]). The idea is to sample a set of short lattice elements
and construct the public key as a Short Integer Solution (SIS for short)
instance. Signatures are obtained using a small subset sum of the secret key,
hidden by a (large) Gaussian mask. (Information leakage is dealt with using
rejection sampling.) Recently, Persichetti proposed an efficient adaptation
of this framework to coding theory [12]. In this paper, we show that this
adaptation cannot be secure, even for one-time signatures (OTS), due to
an inherent difference between bounds in Hamming and Euclidean metrics.
The attack consists in rewriting a signature as a noisy syndrome decoding
problem, which can be handled efficiently using the extended bit flipping
decoding algorithm. We illustrate our results by breaking Persichettiâ€™s OTS
scheme built upon this approach [12]: using a single signature, we recover
the secret (signing) key in about the same amount of time as required for a
couple of signature verifications.
