Abstract
======
The BitFlipping algorithm is a hard decision decoding algorithm originally designed by Gallager in 1962 to
decode Low Density Parity Check Codes (LDPC). It has recently
proved to be much more versatile, for Moderate Parity Check
Codes (MDPC) or Euclidean metric. We further demonstrate its
power by proposing a noisy Euclidean version of it. This tweak
allows to construct a lattice based key exchange analogous to the
Ouroboros protocol for Hamming metric but with a reduction
to the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem. The very efficient
decoding algorithm permits to consider smaller alphabets than
for NTRU or Ring-LWE decryption algorithms. Overall we
obtain a new protocol which competes with the recent NewHope
and Kyber proposals, and also with NTRU. The resulting scheme
exploits the cyclicity of the error, and benefits from the security
of the renowned SIS problem.
