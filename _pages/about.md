Welcome to my homepage ! I am Jean-Christophe Deneuville, post-doc in Computer Science at <a href="">INSA-CVL</a> and <a href="">LIFO</a>, under the supervision of <a href="">Jérémy Briffaut</a>. I earned my Ph.D in 2016, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.unilim.fr/pages_perso/philippe.gaborit/">Philippe Gaborit</a> and <a href="http://www.irit.fr/spip.php?page=annuaire&code=8292">Carlos Aguilar Melchor</a>. My research interests include Cryptography especially based on Error Correcting Codes and Lattices, as well as associated Algorithms for solving hard problems.
